	<p>Here, I'm writing a paragraph between two paragraph tags...</p>
	<p class="special">The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Websites are automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. <em>This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize the hand-quality of websites by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the web.</em> We will examine the space of the web at <strong>large</strong> and explore and challenge what a website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
	<p>Here's a list of some things that I like:</p>
