	<p class="story">Story Mode is the regular campaign in the 2008 LittleBigPlanet game. Here, players can obtain collectible prizes to use in creating their own levels on My Moon.There are eight areas in Story Mode. Each one is maintained by a Creator Curator. Every theme has a set of levels that are played in order. Completing one level will unlock the next one, and completing all the levels in a theme will unlock the next theme. There are also "side challenge" levels in each theme, which can be unlocked by finding a Level Key in one of the main levels.

	<br>
	Most themes (The Wedding, The Islands, The Temples and The Metropolis) have three main levels and three side levels.
